# ScopreML
My own implementation of a machine learning library using only Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and built in python libraries. 
Name is pending as is the application of the module. For now, I'll be exploring how to implement different machine learning libraries, but I intend to make this package different than other options available. Some ways I've been considering are 1) Optimizing performance for both the accuracy of the model on test data and computational time for a given dataset, basically to find the sweet spot between cost and efficacy;  2) Add more user friendly features such as an interface, and easy ways to import data and export models, possibly with predefined access methods through API calls to appropriate services, such as YouTube and other Social Media Platforms.
